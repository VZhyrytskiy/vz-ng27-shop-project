task 6 done: added `CartItemComponent`, implemented adding/removing functionality from Cart

task 7,8, 10 done

task 11 done: added template variable and set app title string from `AppComponent` via `@ViewChild`

task 12 **particularly done**: added `HighlightDirective`, it works fine for `CartListComponent`, but for some reason - **works incorrectly for** `CartItemComponent`. Additional clarification would be good.
